Some cool stuff that I've done in MATLAB and would like to share!


Music Filter Program:
This is a program that takes any sound file and can filter it to produce an output sound file that filters the different frequencies based on user specifications. A few examples on how to use the program are included in the folder along with some sample sound files!

Music Synthesis Program:
This program allows the user to create different string of sounds based on the input musical notes.
